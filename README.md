# How the App works:

When a restaurant has food that hasn't sold or is about to expire, they can register the item they want to sell at a steep discount from the original price, along with a description of the item, on the application. Customers looking to place an order can use the app to find businesses in their area with perishable goods that have yet to be purchased. They'll have the option of setting the radius (say, 5 km) within which they look for these directives. When a customer selects a restaurant or shop using the app, they may view the establishment's current menu and prices with a single click. Afterward, the customer can make a reservation for the meal, which the restaurant or shop will hold for a certain amount of time (e.g., 30, 20, or 10 minutes available for reservation). The user will receive a reminder from the app when it is time to pick up his order. If the buyer doesn't show up, you get to keep the thing.


The restaurant or shop must update the number of remaining meals or items that can be reserved, as well as the number of meals or products that are now available, the time it will take to get the meal, and how long the restaurant or shop will hold the reservation.
